Combined with the lacklu     ster Circus, it was easy to assume that Kravitz had plateaued, de     ciding to recycle lame sub-Hendrix stadium rock instead of crafti     ng the kind of lush, post-psychedelic soul that made his first th     ree records so fine. Then, out of nowhere, he threw out the lovel     y ""Again"" as a new track for Greatest Hits, setting the stage for      the return to form that's Lenny. This, not the empty hard rock o     f Circus and 5, finds Lenny Kravitz at the peak of his powers, cr     afting classic rock homages that get by not only on their melodic      force but in sterling studiocraft that may shamelessly worship c     lassic rock, but gets the sound and texture right. Kravitz has go     tten to the point that his blend of album rock, smooth soul, hipp     ie love, and hipster pop is now his own musical signature -- yes,      it's still possible to play ""spot the influence,"" but it's all b     lended better and presented with an offhand grace, particularly i     n how the gorgeous, enveloping ballads and mid-tempo pop is punct     uated by the rockers that sound much fiercer in this context. The     re may not be singles that are as immediately grabbing as ""It Ain     't Over Til It's Over,"" ""Let Love Rule,"" and ""Are You Gonna Go My      Way,"" but there are no dull spots, either, and this easily stand     s alongside his first three albums as a set of classy, near-irres     istible pop for listeners weaned on classic and college rock, whi     ch is a wholly welcome surprise. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n            Battlefield Of Love       If I Could Fall In Love       Yesterday Is Gone (My Dear Kay)       Stillness Of Heart       Believe In Me       Pay To Play       A Million Miles Away       God Save Us All       Dig In       You Were In My Heart       Bank Robber Man       Let's Get High        ",     a00a560c     Lenny Kravitz     Lenny     rock     Rock     2001      YEAR: 2001 ID3G:  17            Battlefield of love       If i could fall in love       Yesterday is gone (My dear Kay)       Stillness of heart       Believe in me        Pay to pay       A million miles away       God save us all        Dig In       You were in my heart        Bank robber man        Lets get high
